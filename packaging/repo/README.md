# Local repo with erlang runtime.

The R16B03-1 runtime system RPMs for Tizen in this directory was
created by Magnus Feuer (mfeuer@jaguarlandrover.copm). As of this
writing, we were not sure where to put the packages (and their
source), so we dumped them here.

Email Magnus if you want the source code to build your own RPMs.

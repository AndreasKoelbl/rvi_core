In doc and code, convert JSON-RPC param "parameters" to "arguments" in order to avoid
   confusion with JSON-RPC "params"

In doc and code, rename "target" "service" or potentially "target
   service"

In HLD, update data_link_up use case (Step 10) to involve service
   discovery

In HLD, schedule, data link, and service discovery - Fix code so that
   service availability is managed by service discovery only. Today
   the network address of a given service (set by data_link_up calls
   from data_link_device) are received by schedule, which maintains a
   redundant copy of all service availability states. This should be
   moved to Servide Discovery, which should forward the call to
   schedule. HLD

Service Discovery
   Node service prefix matching should return the one with the longest
   prefix match. This allows for default static nodes to be setup with
   only a root prefix that can be used as a fallback.

In doc and code, convert JSON-RPC param "parameters" to "arguments" in order to avoid
   confusion with JSON-RPC "params"

In doc and code, rename "target" "service" or potentially "target
   service"

In HLD, update data_link_up use case (Step 10) to involve service
   discovery

In HLD, schedule, data link, and service discovery - Fix code so that
   service availability is managed by service discovery only. Today
   the network address of a given service (set by data_link_up calls
   from data_link_device) are received by schedule, which maintains a
   redundant copy of all service availability states. This should be
   moved to Servide Discovery, which should forward the call to
   schedule. HLD

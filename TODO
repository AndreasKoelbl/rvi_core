In service_edge_rpc:
   Report local service registrations to other locally connected services.
   Today only remote service registrations are forwarded to the locally connceted services
   through register_remote_service(). When register_service() is invoked from a local service
   registering itself, that registraion should be forwarded to all other local services.


In doc and code, convert JSON-RPC param "parameters" to "arguments" in order to avoid
   confusion with JSON-RPC "params"

In doc and code, rename "target" "service" or potentially "target
   service"

In HLD, update data_link_up use case (Step 10) to involve service
   discovery

In HLD, schedule, data link, and service discovery - Fix code so that
   service availability is managed by service discovery only. Today
   the network address of a given service (set by data_link_up calls
   from data_link_device) are received by schedule, which maintains a
   redundant copy of all service availability states. This should be
   moved to Servide Discovery, which should forward the call to
   schedule. HLD

Service Discovery [Moved to https://github.com/PDXostc/rvi/issues/5]
   Node service prefix matching should return the one with the longest
   prefix match. This allows for default static nodes to be setup with
   only a root prefix that can be used as a fallback.


Scheduler [https://github.com/PDXostc/rvi/issues/6]
   If two different services are invoked on a remote node that is
   currently not available, the services may be invoked out of order
   when the node does become connected. Scheduluer should queue
   messages on a per-node basis, not per-service. 

FIXED:
Data Link
   Any broken connection to a statically configured node should
   periodically get a reconnect attempt.

Service Discovery, Service Edge, Data Link
   If a new local service connects and registers with a Service Edge,
   the service should be announced to other RVI nodes that are
   currently connected to the local node. (Real time service
   announcement)

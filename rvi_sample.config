   %%
   %% Value substitution:
   %% All string values under the rvi tuple tree are scanned
   %% for specific dokens during startup. If a token is 
   %% found, it will be replaced with a value referenced by it.
   %% Tokens can one of the following:
   %% 
   %% $rvi_file(FileName,Default) - File content
   %%   When an $rvi_file() token is encountered, the first line of
   %%   the referenced file is read. The line (without the newline)
   %%   replaces the token.
   %%
   %%   Example: 
   %%     { node_service_prefix, "jlr.com/vin/$rvi_file(/etc/vin,default_vin)"},
   %%
   %%     will be substituted with the first line from the file
   %%     /etc/vin:
   %%
   %%     { node_service_prefix, "jlr.com/vin/2GKEG25HXP4093669"},
   %%   
   %%     If /etc/vin cannot be opened, the value default_vin 
   %%     will be used instead.
   %%
   %%
   %% $rvi_env(EnvironemtnName,Default) - Environment variable
   %%   When an $rvi_env() token is encountered, the value of 
   %%   the Linux process environment variable (such as $HOME) is read
   %%   to replace the token.
   %%
   %%   Example: 
   %%     { node_service_prefix, "jlr.com/vin/$rvi_env(VIN,default_vin)"},
   %%
   %%     will be substituted with the value of the $VIN environment
   %%     variable:
   %%
   %%     { node_service_prefix, "jlr.com/vin/2GKEG25HXP4093669"},
   %%   
   %%     If VIN is not a defined environment variable, the value
   %%     default_vin will be used instead.
   %%
   %%
   %% $rvi_uuid(Default) - Unique machine identifier
   %%   When an $rvi_uuid() token is encountered, the UUID of the root
   %%   disk used by the system is read to replace the token.
   %%   The UUID of the root disk is retrieved by opening /proc/cmdline
   %%   and extracting the root=UUID=[DiskUUID] value.
   %%   This value is generated at system install time and is reasonably
   %%   world wide unique.
   %%
   %%   Example: 
   %%     { node_service_prefix, "jlr.com/vin/$uuid(default_vin)"},
   %%
   %%     will be substituted with the value of the root disk UUID:
   %%
   %%     { node_service_prefix, 
   %%       "jlr.com/vin/afc0a6d8-0264-4f8a-bb3e-51ff8655b51c"},
   %%   
   %%     If the root UUID cannot be retrieved, the value default_vin
   %%     will be used instead.
